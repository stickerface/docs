###Introduction

StickerFace is an NFT avatar creator platform powered by the TON blockchain. StickerFace provides functionality for designing a digital avatar and creating an identity in the virtual world. 

Users can build customizable avatars in a mobile app, and claim ownership of their virtual characters by minting them as NFTs. 
User downloads the app from App Store or Google Play and connects Tonkeeper wallet. Once the avatar is created, it can be minted as an NFT for a small fee. 

Further tailoring of the avatar is possible with additional NFT accessories and wearables that users can purchase on the StickerFace marketplace. 

StickerFace automatically creates a personalized sticker pack that can be integrated into messaging apps or exported to the native keyboard. 

What’s more, StickerFace offers an open-source SDK for developers for web and mobile integrations to provide a truly impressive and unique user experience. 

Users can create avatars in the official StickerFace app for iOS or Android or in another service that has implemented StickerFace SDK.

###Creator kit 

There are two ways to create an avatar: generate it from a selfie with the help of AI or build it using the Creator kit. In case the user wants to adjust the automatically generated avatar, they can do so in the StickerFace app. 

Creator kit is a flexible tool that makes avatar transformation a breeze. Users can adjust the following traits: head, facelines, hair, beard, bristle, moustache, eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth. Trying on and purchasing extra NFT wearables, accessories and backgrounds is also available directly in the creator kit.

Every combination of traits and colors results in a one-of-a-kind avatar. Users can mix and match a myriad of features to create a truly custom-made character. New variations will be added over time, making the number of possible face combinations near infinite.

###Fashion Marketplace

The StickerFace NFT fashion collection consists of 30,000 wearables and accessories. New items will be released for the StickerFace marketplace over the next 5 years. 

The fashion marketplace will include accessories such as glasses or piercings, and wearables including branded shirts, hats, and more. Dressing up the avatar is made easy in StickerFace. 

###Technology

StickerFace is based on the TON blockchain. The application uses TON smart contracts to maintain a ledger of ownership of avatars, wearables, and accessories in the virtual world. Avatars, wearables, and accessories are non-fungible digital assets that a user can  purchase with Toncoins. 
User connects Tonkeeper wallet to the StickerFace app which processes transactions related to NFT purchase and sales. 

###For developers

StickerFace offers an open-source SDK that any project can integrate into web or mobile applications. Your users will be able to create a customizable NFT avatar right in your app or service. The setup process is quick and simple — **StickerFace SDK has all the necessary features for the implementation process to go smoothly.** 
The project is available on GitHub. Developers can download the SDK from GitHub Repositories: iOS, Android, Web. 
Main flow is to open Stickerface popup view where users can customize their avatars. Also Stickerface SDK allows to perform operations with avatars and render them with various parameters. Each avatar can be described by a config string which looks like a list of elements identifiers): 
```83;159;13;71;12;47;85;69;1;43;21;3;160;216;16;100.```
There are several ways to render avatars:
 – Server render in PNG;
 – Server render in SVG;
 – Client side render over SDK.

When rendering the client side, it’s important to keep in mind that while rendering is instant and in many cases doesn’t perform any network requests, sometimes it does due to downloading some parts or elements which are not yet cached.
